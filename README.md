## The Case at a Glance

### The Four Pillars of Truth

#### 1. The 130-Day Gap (Contempt)
**What**: 129 consecutive days (42% of Harper's first year) of court-ordered access denied

**Key Evidence**:
- **June 18, 2025 email** (Exhibit A-8): *"You won't see Harper until we see a judge in October"*
- **18 denied Sundays** with documented pickup attempts
- **Oct 6 order violation**: New court order defied within 4 days

**Document**: [130-Day Gap Timeline](./130_DAY_GAP_TIMELINE.md)

---

#### 2. The System Loop (Institutional Fraud)
**What**: Network of undisclosed conflicts enabling bias

**Key Actors**:
- **Jane Ryan** (grandmother) ↔ **Deputy Chief Henderson** (SJPF)
- **Jacqueline Gallant** (social worker) ↔ **Emma's brother** (personal friend)
- **Kerrie Garland** (Emma's sister-in-law) → Commissioned conflicted affidavit

**Key Evidence**:
- **Formal complaints** against Jane Ryan (Ranks #1-2; Score: 160)
- **NBASW complaint** against Jacqueline Gallant (Rank #3; 105 points)
- **Jane Ryan Oct 22 text**: *"Take ME to court yourself"*
- **"Negative-Dilute" acceptance**: Jacqueline Gallant accepted suspect drug test without follow-up

**Document**: [System Loop Exposure](./SYSTEM_LOOP_ARCHITECTURAL_FRAUD.md)

---

#### 3. Respondent Fitness (Craig Schulz)
**What**: Comprehensive proof of superior parental capability

**Key Evidence**:
- ✅ **Clean drug tests** (immediate compliance)
- ✅ **13 months of primary care** (Dec 9, 2024 - Jan 21, 2026)
- ✅ **PLACED.ca + Harper's Place** (21.6MB stability blueprint)
- ✅ **Employment stability** ($531 vet bill paid)
- ✅ **Criminal acquittal** (Sept 29, 2025 - proves credibility)

**Document**: [Respondent Fitness Package](./RESPONDENT_FITNESS_PACKAGE.md)

---

#### 4. Hard Evidence (Violence & Endangerment)
**What**: Irrefutable proof of Emma's unfitness

**Key Evidence**:
- 🎥 **1.4GB Dec 9 video** (assault captured on camera)
- 📸 **"Where's my drugs?!"** screenshot (Exhibit A-87)
- 👮 **Criminal charge** (Sept 21, 2025 - assault)
- 💊 **"Meth in breastmilk" text** (Nov 30, 2024 - Harper 18 days old)
- 💸 **Jane Ryan drug facilitation** (Dec 8, 2024 text)
- 🧪 **"Negative-Dilute" drug test** (Jan 6, 2025 - evasion)

**Document**: [Hard Evidence Compilation](./ASSAULT_ENDANGERMENT_EVIDENCE.md)

## Legal Arguments Summary

### What We're Asking the Court

**Primary Relief**:
1. ✅ **Sole Decision-Making Authority** → Craig Schulz
2. ✅ **Primary Residence** → Craig Schulz
3. 🔴 **Supervised Access Only** → Emma Ryan (pending rehabilitation)
4. 🚫 **Exclude Jane Ryan** → From supervision/facilitation
5. ⚖️ **Finding of Contempt** → 129-day denial; award costs and compensatory time
6. 👶 **Appoint Independent Legal Counsel** → Harper's independent voice

**Secondary Relief**:
7. 🔍 **Order Drug Testing** → Hair follicle (90-day window) for Emma
8. 📋 **Refer for Investigation** → RCMP (Henderson-Jane Ryan); NBASW (Jacqueline Gallant); Provincial Ombudsman

---

### Why We'll Win

**Family Services Act s. 17 Analysis**:

| Factor | Craig ✅ | Emma 🚩 |
|---|---|---|
| **(a) Safety & Security** | Removed Harper from unsafe environment | Assault, meth, child endangerment |
| **(b) Physical/Emotional Needs** | 13 months of care; Harper thriving | Attachment disruption via 129-day denial |
| **(h) Facilitate Relationship** | ✅ 100% compliance; 18 pickup attempts | 🚩 **DISPOSITIVE FAILURE**: 129-day denial |
| **(k) Family Violence** | Victim (documented) | Perpetrator (charged Sept 21) |

**Conclusion**: Factor (h) alone — **willingness to facilitate relationship** — is **DISPOSITIVE**. Emma's 129-day denial + June 18 admission prove fundamental incapability.
