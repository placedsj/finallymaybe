### Cross-Examination (Opposing Counsel Questions You)

**Mental Preparation**:
- Emma's lawyer will try to make you look bad
- They may be aggressive, sarcastic, or leading
- **Your job**: Stay calm, stick to facts, use evidence

**Defense Strategies**:

**Attack: "You're violent too"**
- [ ] Response: "No. Emma assaulted me multiple times. Police charged her, not me. Crown charged her September 21, 2025, not me."

**Attack: "You use drugs too"**
- [ ] Response: "I've been sober since [DATE]. Clean tests December 9, January 31. Emma's test was 'Negative-Dilute'—she tried to evade."

**Attack: "You took Harper to hurt Emma"**
- [ ] Response: "I removed Harper from a meth-filled apartment after Emma assaulted me while I held her. I called police, cooperated with CPS, got tested. That's protection, not punishment."

**Attack: "You're trying to control Emma"**
- [ ] Response: "No. I tried to settle in January 2025. I chose not to file my 103-point rebuttal. Emma repaid that with 129 days of contempt."

**If You Don't Know**:
- [ ] Say: "I don't recall" or "I don't know"

**Listen For**:
- [ ] Do they emphasize June 18 email?
