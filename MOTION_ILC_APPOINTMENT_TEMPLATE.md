## GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION

The grounds for this motion are:

### 1. **Conflicts of Interest Undermine Integrity of Proceedings**

1.1 This motion is brought to ensure Harper's voice is heard through a neutral, independent representative given the **documented conflicts of interest** that have compromised the integrity of these proceedings.

#### 1.1.1 **Jane Ryan ↔ Deputy Chief Wayne Henderson (SJPF)**

1.1.1.1 Jane Ryan (Applicant's mother) has a personal relationship with Deputy Chief Wayne Henderson of the Saint John Police Force.

1.1.1.2 Despite:
   - Jane Ryan's facilitation of a methamphetamine purchase for the Applicant on December 8, 2024 (one day before the December 9, 2024 assault incident) **[Text C-3]**
   - Jane Ryan's written admission of gatekeeping (*"Take ME to court yourself"*) on October 22, 2025 **[Exhibit A-9]**
   - Jane Ryan's contempt of the October 6, 2025 court order naming her as exchange facilitator

...no investigation has been conducted into Jane Ryan's conduct.

1.1.1.3 This relationship creates a **conflict of interest** that prevents impartial law enforcement response.

#### 1.1.2 **Jacqueline Gallant (NBASW Social Worker) ↔ Applicant's Brother**

1.1.2.1 Jacqueline Gallant, the New Brunswick Association of Social Workers (NBASW) registered social worker assigned to investigate child protection concerns following the December 9, 2024 incident, has an **undisclosed personal relationship** with the Applicant's brother.

1.1.2.2 Ms. Gallant:
   - **Failed to disclose** this conflict of interest (violation of NBASW Code of Ethics)
   - Accepted the Applicant's "Negative-Dilute" drug test result **[Exhibit A-5]** on January 6, 2025 without requiring follow-up testing (hair follicle test)
   - Prematurely closed the Child Protective Services file despite ongoing risk factors
   - Failed to investigate methamphetamine exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding

1.1.2.3 A formal complaint was filed with NBASW documenting **105 points of evidence** of Ms. Gallant's professional misconduct **[NBASW Complaint Documentation]**.

1.1.2.4 NBASW **refused to investigate** the complaint, demonstrating regulatory capture.

#### 1.1.3 **Kerrie Garland (Commissioner of Oaths) ↔ Applicant (Sister-in-Law)**

1.1.3.1 Kerrie Garland is the Applicant's sister-in-law (married to the Applicant's brother).

1.1.3.2 From January 12-18, 2025, Kerrie Garland acted as a **mediator** between the Respondent and Applicant, facilitating settlement discussions. During these discussions:
   - The Respondent revealed he had a 103-point rebuttal to the Applicant's affidavit but chose not to file it to protect the Applicant
   - The Respondent and Applicant reached a settlement agreement
   - Kerrie witnessed the Respondent's good faith and restraint

1.1.3.3 Despite this mediation role, Kerrie Garland subsequently **commissioned the Applicant's foundational affidavit** as a Commissioner of Oaths.

1.1.3.4 This creates a **conflict of interest** rendering the affidavit void ab initio. A neutral Commissioner cannot act after serving as mediator with direct knowledge of settlement discussions.

1.1.3.5 The Respondent has filed a motion to strike the Applicant's affidavit based on this conflict **[Motion to Strike]**.

### 2. **Harper's Best Interests Require Neutral Voice**

2.1 Harper June Elizabeth Ryan is **13 months old** (as of January 21, 2026). She cannot speak for herself.

2.2 Given the documented conflicts of interest involving:
   - Law enforcement (Henderson ↔ Jane Ryan)
   - Child protection (Gallant ↔ Applicant's brother)
   - Oath administration (Kerrie Garland ↔ Applicant)

...Harper's best interests require **independent, neutral representation** to ensure her voice is heard without institutional bias.

2.3 The parents' positions are adversarial:
   - Respondent seeks sole decision-making and primary residence
   - Applicant seeks [primary residence/shared decision-making/etc. - based on her filings]

2.4 An Independent Legal Counsel (ILC) can provide the Court with an **objective assessment** of Harper's best interests, free from parental conflict and institutional bias.

### 3. **Complexity and Seriousness of Issues**

3.1 This case involves serious allegations that warrant independent investigation:

#### 3.1.1 **Violence**
   - December 9, 2024 assault (Applicant assaulted Respondent while he held Harper) **[1.4GB Video Evidence]**
   - Criminal charge filed September 21, 2025 (assault charge pending)
   - Pattern of violence (November 19, November 30, December 9, 2024)

#### 3.1.2 **Substance Abuse**
   - Applicant's admission of "meth in breastmilk" (November 30, 2024 - Harper 18 days old) **[Text A-11]**
   - Jane Ryan's facilitation of methamphetamine purchase (December 8, 2024) **[Text C-3]**
   - "Negative-Dilute" drug test (January 6, 2025 - suspected adulteration) **[Exhibit A-5]**
   - Drug use during pregnancy (November 8, 2024 admission - 4 days before Harper's birth)

#### 3.1.3 **Child Endangerment**
   - Harper present during December 9 assault (in Respondent's arms)
   - Severe diaper rash discovered upon removal (evidence of neglect) **[Photo A-6]**
   - Low birth weight (2120g/4lbs 11oz) and NICU admission (potential prenatal drug exposure)

#### 3.1.4 **Contempt of Court**
   - 129 consecutive days of denied access (June 4 - October 10, 2025)
   - Written admission of intent (June 18, 2025 email: *"You will not see Harper until we see a judge in October"*) **[Exhibit A-8]**
   - Violation of October 6, 2025 Further Interim Order within 4 days

3.2 The **complexity and seriousness** of these allegations require an independent professional to investigate and advocate for Harper's best interests.

### 4. **ILC Can Investigate Without Institutional Bias**

4.1 An ILC would:
   - Conduct independent interviews (free from Henderson/Gallant/Kerrie Garland conflicts)
   - Review all evidence objectively
   - Investigate the Applicant's current fitness (sobriety, compliance with orders)
   - Investigate the Respondent's current fitness (sobriety, stability, parenting capacity)
   - Assess Harper's developmental needs and attachment status
   - Provide the Court with recommendations based on Harper's best interests (not parental preferences)

4.2 The ILC's investigation would address the institutional failures that have allowed Harper to remain in a potentially unsafe environment despite:
   - Criminal assault charges
   - Admitted drug use while breastfeeding
   - Systematic contempt of court orders

### 5. **Legal Basis for ILC Appointment**

5.1 **Family Services Act, SNB 1980, c F-2.2, s. 28**:

> *"28(1) The court may appoint counsel to represent a child in a proceeding under this Act if the court is of the opinion that the child's interests should be separately represented.*
>
> *28(2) Counsel appointed under subsection (1) shall represent the best interests of the child and may adduce evidence and make submissions to the court."*

5.2 The Court has broad discretion to appoint ILC where warranted. Factors supporting appointment include:
   - **Conflicts of interest** (as documented above)
   - **Complexity of issues** (violence, substance abuse, contempt)
   - **Seriousness of allegations** (child endangerment, criminal charges)
   - **Inability of child to self-represent** (Harper is 13 months old)

5.3 This case meets all criteria for ILC appointment.
