## The Case in 60 Seconds

**Harper June Elizabeth Ryan** (DOB: Nov 12, 2024) has been systematically endangered by her mother (Emma Ryan) and maternal family, with institutional cover-up enabled by conflicts of interest.

**The Four Pillars of Truth**:

### 1. **The 130-Day Gap** (June 4 - Oct 10, 2025)
- **129 consecutive days** of court-ordered access denied
- **42% of Harper's first year** lost to gatekeeping
- **Smoking Gun**: June 18 email: *"You won't see Harper until we see a judge in October"*
- **Impact**: Attachment disruption during ages 6-10 months (critical period)

### 2. **The System Loop** (Institutional Capture)
- **Jane Ryan** (grandmother) → **Deputy Chief Henderson** (SJPF) = Investigation blocked
- **Jacqueline Gallant** (social worker) → **Emma's brother** = Undisclosed conflict; biased investigation
- **NBASW** → Refuses to investigate Gallant despite 105-point complaint
- **Kerrie Garland** (Emma's sister-in-law) → Commissioned conflicted affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths

### 3. **Respondent Fitness** (Craig Schulz)
- ✅ **Clean drug tests** (immediate compliance)
- ✅ **13 months of primary care** (Dec 9, 2024 - present)
- ✅ **PLACED.ca + Harper's Place** (21.6MB stability blueprint)
- ✅ **Employment stability** ($531 vet bill paid; financial responsibility)
- ✅ **Criminal acquittal** (Sept 29, 2025 - fraud trial; proves credibility)

### 4. **Hard Evidence** (Violence & Endangerment)
- 🚩 **1.4GB video**: December 9 assault captured on camera
- 🚩 **"Where's my drugs?!"**: Emma's drug-seeking during assault
- 🚩 **Criminal charge**: Emma charged with assault (Sept 21, 2025)
- 🚩 **Pattern of violence**: Black eye (Nov 19) → Mirror (Nov 30) → Knife → Dec 9
- 🚩 **Child endangerment**: Meth in breastmilk admission (Nov 30); Harper present during Dec 9 assault

**The Verdict**: Emma Ryan is fundamentally unfit for unsupervised access. Craig Schulz has demonstrated superior fitness and must be awarded sole decision-making and primary residence.

## Part II: The Evidence Summary

### Category A: The 130-Day Gap

**What**: 129 consecutive days (June 4 - Oct 10, 2025) of denied court-ordered access

**Key Evidence**:
- **18 denied Sundays** with documented pickup attempts (text logs, call logs, photo timestamps)
- **June 18, 2025 email** (Exhibit A-8): Written admission of intent
- **Oct 6 order violation**: New court order defied within 4 days
- **36-day communication blackout** (Sept 5 - Oct 10): Zero contact

**Impact on Harper**:
- **42% of first year lost** (129 of 306 days from birth to Oct 10)
- **Critical attachment period disrupted** (ages 6-10 months)
- **Developmental milestones missed**: Crawling, first foods, language development
- **Behavioral harm**: Night terrors, difficulty settling post-denial

**Legal Significance**: Willful, systematic contempt of multiple court orders with written admission of intent.

---

### Category B: The System Loop

**What**: Network of undisclosed conflicts of interest that enabled institutional bias

**The Chain**:

```
Jane Ryan (Grandmother) ──personal──→ Deputy Chief Henderson (SJPF)
       │                                          │
       │ Facilitates                              │ Fails to
       │ Drug Purchase                            │ Investigate
       ↓                                          ↓
Emma Ryan (Applicant) ──brother's friend──→ Jacqueline Gallant (Social Worker)
       ↓                                          │
   Charged with                                   │ Undisclosed
   Assault (Sept 21)                             │ Conflict
                                                  ↓
                                           Accepts "Negative-Dilute"
                                           Without Follow-Up
```

**Key Conflicts**:

1. **Jane Ryan ↔ Deputy Chief Henderson**
   - Personal relationship prevents impartial investigation
   - No action taken on Jane's drug facilitation (Dec 8 text)
   - No enforcement of court order violations

2. **Jacqueline Gallant ↔ Emma's Brother**
   - Undisclosed personal relationship
   - Biased investigation favoring Applicant
   - Accepted "negative-dilute" drug test without follow-up (gross negligence)
   - Prematurely closed CPS file despite ongoing risk

3. **Kerrie Garland ↔ Emma Ryan (Sister-in-Law)**
   - Acted as mediator (Jan 12-18 dialogue with Craig)
   - Later commissioned Emma's foundational affidavit as Commissioner of Oaths
   - **Conflict**: Cannot act as neutral oath-giver after mediating case

4. **NBASW ↔ Jacqueline Gallant**
   - Refused to investigate 105-point complaint against Gallant
   - Regulatory capture protects social worker over child

**Legal Significance**: Systemic fraud; institutional actors prioritizing adult relationships over Harper's welfare.

**Criminal Validation**:

**Legal Significance**: Pattern of escalating violence + ongoing child endangerment = Emma is unfit for unsupervised access.

## Part IV: Legal Analysis - Why Harper's Best Interests Demand Change

### Family Services Act, s. 17 - Best Interests Factors

| Factor | Craig Schulz ✅ | Emma Ryan 🚩 |
|---|---|---|
| **(a) Child's safety & security** | Removed Harper from unsafe environment (Dec 9); 13 months of safe care | Assault while holding Harper; meth in apartment; charged criminally |
| **(b) Physical, psychological & emotional needs** | All needs met; Harper thriving | Attachment disruption via 129-day denial; developmental harm |
| **(c) Child's age & stage of development** | Age-appropriate care; PLACED.ca/Harper's Place designed for long-term development | Denied access during critical attachment period (6-10 months) |
| **(d) Nature & strength of relationships** | Consistent care since birth (except 129-day denial); present in delivery room | Weaponized relationship to inflict harm; gatekeeping |
| **(e) History of care-giving** | 13 months of primary care post-Dec 9; prior co-parent | Pattern of neglect (diaper rash); substance use while caring for Harper |
| **(f) Plans for care & upbringing** | PLACED.ca platform; Harper's Place app; 21.6MB Blueprint | No documented plans; reliance on maternal family (Jane Ryan = threat) |
| **(g) Permanence & stability** | Stable housing, employment, sobriety 13+ months | Substance use, violence, relies on Jane Ryan (who obstructs orders) |
| **(h) Ability & willingness to facilitate relationship with other parent** | Attempted 18 consecutive Sundays; reached settlement (Jan 18); used legal process, not self-help | **COMPLETE FAILURE**: 129-day denial; June 18 admission; Jane Ryan "Take ME to court" text |
| **(i) Views & preferences of child** | Too young to express (13 months old) | Too young to express |
| **(j) Effect of delay** | 13 months in Respondent's care = stability; delay harms Harper if returned to Applicant | 129-day denial caused measurable harm; further delay endangers Harper |
| **(k) Risk of family violence** | **VICTIM** of violence; no reciprocal aggression documented | **PERPETRATOR**: Charged with assault (Sept 21); pattern (black eye, mirror, knife, Dec 9) |
| **(l) Civil or criminal proceedings** | Acquitted (Sept 29 fraud trial); proves credibility | Charged with assault (Sept 21, 2025 - PENDING) |

**Conclusion**: Factor **(h) - Willingness to facilitate relationship** is **DISPOSITIVE**. Emma's 129-day denial, June 18 admission, and Jane Ryan's obstruction prove she is **fundamentally incapable** of co-parenting.

---

### Requested Relief

**The Court Must Order**:

1. **SOLE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY** to Respondent (Craig Schulz)
   - Basis: Emma's contempt, violence, substance use, and facilitation by Jane Ryan render her unfit

2. **PRIMARY RESIDENCE** with Respondent
   - Basis: 13 months of stable care; Harper thriving; Emma's unfitness established

3. **SUPERVISED ACCESS ONLY** for Applicant (pending rehabilitation)
   - Supervision required due to: violence, substance use, contempt pattern
   - Conditions: Drug testing (hair follicle, 90-day window); completion of anger management; demonstrated compliance with court orders for 6+ months

4. **JANE RYAN EXCLUDED** from Supervision or Facilitation
   - Basis: Drug facilitation (Dec 8 text); gatekeeping admission (Oct 22 text); contempt of Oct 6 order

5. **FINDING OF CONTEMPT**
   - 129-day denial (June 4 - Oct 10, 2025)
   - Violation of Jan 14, March 22, and Oct 6 interim orders
   - Award costs and compensatory parenting time to Respondent

6. **APPOINT INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL** for Harper
   - Basis: Systemic conflicts (Jane Ryan ↔ Henderson; Jacqueline Gallant ↔ Emma's brother; Kerrie Garland ↔ Emma)
   - Harper's voice needs neutral representation

7. **ORDER DRUG TESTING** for Applicant
   - Hair follicle test (90-day detection window)
   - Observed collection to prevent dilution/adulteration

8. **REFER FOR INVESTIGATION**
   - **Jane Ryan**: Criminal investigation for drug facilitation, contempt
   - **Deputy Chief Henderson**: RCMP review of relationship with Jane Ryan; conflict of interest
   - **Jacqueline Gallant**: NBASW professional conduct investigation
   - **Kerrie Garland**: Review of Commissioner of Oaths conduct; potential breach of oath

## Part V: The Bottom Line

**Harper June Elizabeth Ryan deserves better than to be:**
- ❌ Weaponized to inflict harm on her father
- ❌ Exposed to violence and methamphetamine
- ❌ Denied 42% of her first year with her father
- ❌ Failed by a system that protects institutional actors over children

**Harper June Elizabeth Ryan deserves:**
- ✅ A primary parent who is sober, stable, and safe (Craig Schulz)
- ✅ A future planned with innovation and love (PLACED.ca, Harper's Place)
- ✅ Protection from a violent, substance-using parent (supervised access only for Emma)
- ✅ Freedom from the maternal family's obstruction (Jane Ryan excluded)
- ✅ Independent legal representation to ensure her voice is heard

**The Evidence is Overwhelming. The Law is Clear. The Court Must Act.**
