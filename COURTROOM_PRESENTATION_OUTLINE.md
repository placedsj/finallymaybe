**[Stand, face judge, pause 2 seconds]**

---

#### HOOK (30 seconds)

> "Your Honour, on June 18, 2025, the Applicant sent the Respondent an email. It said: *'You will not see Harper until we see a judge in October.'*  
>  
> [Hold up Exhibit A-8]  
>  
> That email is Exhibit A-8. For the next 129 days—42% of Harper's first year—the Applicant denied every court-ordered Sunday. Not once. Not twice. Eighteen consecutive Sundays.  
>  
> That email isn't a dispute. It's a confession of contempt."

---

#### ROADMAP (1 minute)

> "Your Honour, the evidence before you proves four things:  
>  
> **First**, the Applicant is fundamentally unfit due to wilful contempt of court orders. June 18 email. 129 days. Violation of your October 6 order within four days.  
>  
> **Second**, the Applicant is fundamentally unfit due to violence. December 9, 2024 assault—captured on video [hold up USB]—while the Respondent held one-month-old Harper. The Crown charged the Applicant with assault on September 21, 2025. That charge is pending.  
>  
> **Third**, the Applicant is fundamentally unfit due to substance abuse. Meth use during pregnancy. 'Meth in breastmilk' text admission when Harper was 18 days old. 'Negative-Dilute' drug test on January 6, 2025—the Applicant tried to cheat.  
>  
> **Fourth**, the Respondent has provided 13 months of sober, stable care. Clean drug tests. Employment. A 21-megabyte blueprint for Harper's future called PLACED.ca and Harper's Place.  
>  
> I'll walk you through each in order."

---

#### THE STORY (3-4 minutes)

**[Pause, make eye contact with judge]**

> **November to December 2024: The Pattern of Violence**  
>  
> "Your Honour, this case begins with a pattern. On November 19, 2024, the Applicant gave the Respondent a black eye [Photo A-75]. On November 30, 2024, the Applicant assaulted the Respondent with a glass mirror. The Applicant's brother, Matt, witnessed it [Video evidence]. On the same day, the Applicant sent a text message admitting 'meth in breastmilk' [Text A-11]. Harper was 18 days old.  
>  
> On December 8, 2024, the Applicant's mother—Jane Ryan—e-transferred money to the Applicant for a methamphetamine purchase. Jane Ryan's text said: *'I don't want Craig to flip out.'* [Text C-3].  
>  
> On December 9, 2024, at 6-7 AM, the Respondent woke to a meth-filled apartment. The Applicant was agitated, intoxicated. The Respondent picked up Harper—one month old—to comfort her. The Applicant became violent. She struck the Respondent with a shower curtain rod and a shampoo bottle while he held Harper. She screamed: *'Where's my drugs?!'*  
>  
> [Hold up Screenshot Exhibit A-87]  
>  
> The Respondent recorded it. We have a 1.4-gigabyte video [hold up USB]. You will see the assault. You will hear 'Where's my drugs?!' You will see Harper in the Respondent's arms.  
>  
> The Respondent called the police. They came. They interviewed both parties. They charged the Applicant with assault. SJPF File #25-2390069. On September 21, 2025—nine months later—the Crown Attorney formally charged the Applicant. That charge is pending.  
>  
> The Respondent removed Harper from the meth-filled environment. He discovered Harper had a severe diaper rash [Photo A-6]. He cooperated with Child Protective Services. He submitted to a drug test that same day. Negative. Clean. [Show drug test result]."  

---

> **January 2025: The Respondent Tries Settlement**  
>  
> "Your Honour, from January 12 to 18, 2025, the Respondent tried to settle. He mediated with Kerrie Garland, the Applicant's sister-in-law. In those conversations, the Respondent told Kerrie he had a 103-point rebuttal to the Applicant's affidavit. He had audio from December 9 that contradicted the Applicant's statements. But he chose not to file it.  
>  
> Why? Because he wanted to co-parent for Harper's sake. On January 18, he told Kerrie: *'I'll own it all. I built the case for her. I won't drag her through the mud.'*  
>  
> On January 18, they reached an agreement. The Respondent thought the war was over. He was wrong."

---

> **June 4 - October 10, 2025: The 129-Day Contempt**  
>  
> "Your Honour, on June 4, 2025, the Applicant began denying court-ordered Sunday access. Every Sunday, 8 AM to 4 PM. The Respondent showed up. Eighteen consecutive Sundays. [Hold up Calendar A-8]. Text logs. Call logs. Photo timestamps.  
>  
> Every Sunday, he was denied.  
>  
> On June 18, 2025, the Applicant sent this email [hold up Exhibit A-8]:  
>  
> *'You will not see Harper until we see a judge in October.'*  
>  
> That email is dated three days after Father's Day. The Applicant denied the Respondent Harper on Father's Day 2025.  
>  
> The Applicant's contempt continued for 129 consecutive days. 42% of Harper's first year. Harper was six to ten months old—the most critical attachment period in her life.  
>  
> On September 21, 2025—during this denial period—the Crown charged the Applicant with assault for December 9. Yet the denial continued.  
>  
> On October 6, 2025, this Court issued a Further Interim Order. Master Maude reaffirmed Sunday access and named Jane Ryan—the Applicant's mother—as exchange facilitator to compel compliance.  
>  
> Four days later—October 7, 8, 9, 10—the Applicant violated the fresh order. She denied access for four more days.  
>  
> On October 13, seven days after being named facilitator, Jane Ryan blocked the Respondent on Facebook.  
>  
> On October 22, Jane Ryan sent the Respondent a text: [Hold up Exhibit A-9]  
>  
> *'Take ME to court yourself.'*  
>  
> That's an admission of gatekeeping. That's contempt of this Court's October 6 order."

---

> **The Respondent's Fitness**  
>  
> "Your Honour, while the Applicant was denying access, the Respondent was building Harper's future. He enrolled in Celebrate Recovery. He submitted to drug testing on January 31, 2025—clean. He paid a $531 veterinary bill on January 9, 2025—financial responsibility during a legal crisis. He developed PLACED.ca, a comprehensive coparenting platform, and Harper's Place, a personal app for Harper's care. He created a 21.6-megabyte blueprint for Harper's stability.  
>  
> He didn't just fight this case. He built Harper a future."

---

#### THE ASK (1 minute)

> "Your Honour, Harper June Elizabeth Ryan has already lost:  
>  
> - 129 days with her father  
> - Father's Day 2025  
> - Her first birthday  
> - Christmas 2025  
>  
> She's lost 42% of her first year to weaponized gatekeeping.  
>  
> I respectfully request this Court:  
>  
> 1. **Award sole decision-making authority to the Respondent**  
> 2. **Award primary residence to the Respondent**  
> 3. **Restrict the Applicant to supervised access only**, pending rehabilitation  
> 4. **Exclude Jane Ryan from supervision or facilitation**  
> 5. **Find the Applicant in contempt** for the 129-day denial and award costs and compensatory parenting time  
> 6. **Appoint Independent Legal Counsel** for Harper  
>  
> Harper deserves a sober, stable, safe primary parent. That's the Respondent. The Applicant needs help. Supervised access protects Harper while giving the Applicant a chance to rehabilitate."

---

#### CLOSE (30 seconds)

> "Your Honour, this isn't a dispute between two parents. This is a rescue of a 13-month-old child who has been weaponized, endangered, and denied her father for 129 days.  
>  
> The evidence is irrefutable. The law is clear. Harper's best interests demand change.  
>  
> Thank you."

**[Pause 2 seconds. Sit down]**

2. **Rebut Applicant's Case** (3-4 minutes) - Destroy her credibility

4. **Final Appeal** (1 minute) - Emotional close for Harper

---

### Full Closing Argument Script

---

#### RECAP (1 minute)

> "Your Honour, over the past [X] days, you've heard testimony and seen evidence. Let me remind you what the evidence proved:  
>  
> **First**: A 1.4-gigabyte video of the Applicant assaulting the Respondent while he held Harper. Audio of the Applicant screaming, 'Where's my drugs?!' A criminal charge by the Crown on September 21, 2025.  
>  
> **Second**: A June 18, 2025 email admitting the Applicant would deny access 'until we see a judge in October.' 129 consecutive days. 18 denied Sundays. Every attempt documented.  
>  
> **Third**: A November 30 text admitting 'meth in breastmilk.' A January 6, 2025 drug test result—'Negative-Dilute'—proving evasion. A December 8 text from Jane Ryan facilitating a meth purchase.  
>  
> **Fourth**: The Respondent's 13 months of stable care. Clean drug tests. A 21.6-megabyte blueprint for Harper's future.  
>  
> The question is not whether Harper's best interests favor the Respondent. The question is: how can they not?"

---

#### REBUT APPLICANT'S CASE (3-4 minutes)

**[Address anticipated defenses]**

> **'Craig Was Violent Too'**  
>  
> "Your Honour, the Applicant may argue this was mutual combat. The evidence says otherwise. The police charged the Applicant, not the Respondent. The Crown charged the Applicant on September 21, 2025, not the Respondent. Third parties—the criminal justice system—validated that the Respondent was the victim.  
>  
> Yes, in the videos, you might see the Respondent holding the Applicant's arms. That's called defending yourself. That's called protecting a one-month-old baby in your arms. If that were aggression, the police would have charged him. They didn't."

---

> **'Craig Used Drugs Too'**  
>  
> "Your Honour, the Applicant may say the Respondent struggled with substance use. He admits it. But here's the difference:  
>  
> The Respondent got sober. The Applicant tried to cheat a drug test.  
>  
> The Respondent submitted to testing on December 9—clean. January 31—clean. The Applicant submitted on January 6—'Negative-Dilute.' That's a red flag.  
>  
> The Respondent enrolled in Celebrate Recovery. The Applicant has no documented recovery efforts.  
>  
> The Respondent used honesty. The Applicant used evasion.  
>  
> Those are not the same."

---

> **'Craig Took Harper to Hurt Emma'**  
>  
> "Your Honour, the Applicant may say the Respondent removed Harper on December 9 to punish her. Let's examine that.  
>  
> The Respondent called the police. He cooperated with Child Protective Services. He submitted to immediate drug testing. He documented Harper's severe diaper rash. He didn't flee. He didn't hide. He used the legal system.  
>  
> If this were about revenge, why did he try to settle in January 2025? Why did he tell Kerrie Garland he'd 'own it all' to avoid dragging the Applicant through court? Why did he choose not to file his 103-point rebuttal?  
>  
> The answer: because he prioritized Harper over revenge.  
>  
> And the Applicant repaid that good faith with 129 days of contempt."

---

> **Applicant's Credibility Is Destroyed**  
>  
> "Your Honour, the Applicant's testimony cannot be trusted. Here's why:  
>  
> She sent a June 18 email admitting she'd deny access. Then she denied access 18 times.  
>  
> She admitted 'meth in breastmilk' in a text. Then her drug test came back 'Negative-Dilute.'  
>  
> She violated your October 6 order within four days. Her mother, Jane Ryan, text the Respondent: 'Take ME to court yourself.'  
>  
> At every turn, when given a choice between honesty and evasion, the Applicant chose evasion. The evidence speaks louder than her testimony."

---

#### EMPHASIZE DISPOSITIVE FACTOR (2 minutes)

> "Your Honour, Family Services Act section 17 lists the factors for determining best interests. Let me focus on one:  
>  
> **Section 17(h): The ability and willingness of each person to facilitate contact between the child and the other parent.**  
>  
> This factor is dispositive. Here's why:  
>  
> The Applicant sent a written confession on June 18: 'You won't see Harper until October.' She then proved it. 129 days. 18 Sundays. Even after your October 6 order, she violated it for four more days.  
>  
> The Respondent attempted every Sunday. Documented every attempt. Used the legal process. Filed motions for enforcement. Did not retaliate. Did not engage in self-help.  
>  
> One parent facilitated. One parent obstructed.  
>  
> The law is clear: a parent who willfully obstructs the other parent's relationship with the child is unfit for shared decision-making. The Applicant's 129-day denial proves she is fundamentally incapable of co-parenting.  
>  
> Sole decision-making must go to the Respondent. Supervised access protects Harper while giving the Applicant a chance to rehabilitate."

---

#### FINAL APPEAL (1 minute)

> "Your Honour, Harper June Elizabeth Ryan is 13 months old. She has already lost:  
>  
> - 129 days with her father  
> - 42% of her first year  
> - Father's Day 2025  
> - Her first birthday  
> - Christmas 2025  
> - The most critical attachment period in her life  
>  
> She didn't lose these because of illness. Not because of distance. She lost them because her mother sent an email saying, 'You won't see Harper until we see a judge in October.'  
>  
> Harper deserves better. She deserves a sober, stable, safe primary parent. That's the Respondent.  
>  
> She deserves protection from violence and drugs. That requires supervised access for the Applicant.  
>  
> She deserves a future planned with love and innovation. The Respondent built her that future—PLACED.ca, Harper's Place, a 21.6-megabyte blueprint.  
>  
> Your Honour, the evidence is overwhelming. The law is clear. Harper's best interests are undeniable.  
>  
> I respectfully ask this Court to act—not for the Respondent, not for the Applicant, but for Harper.  
>  
> Thank you."

**[Pause 3 seconds. Sit down]**

## KEY TALKING POINTS (Memorize These)

### The 129-Day Gap
- "129 consecutive days"
- "42% of Harper's first year"
- "18 denied Sundays, 18 documented attempts"
- "June 18 email: written confession of contempt"
- "Even violated October 6 order within 4 days"

### December 9 Assault
- "1.4 gigabytes of video—irrefutable proof"
- "'Where's my drugs?!'—audio captured"
- "Harper in Respondent's arms—child present"
- "Police charged Applicant same day"
- "Crown charged Applicant September 21, 2025"

### Substance Use
- "'Meth in breastmilk' text—Harper 18 days old"
- "'Negative-Dilute' drug test—evasion"
- "Jane Ryan facilitated meth purchase December 8"
- "Respondent: clean tests, Celebrate Recovery"

### Respondent's Fitness
- "13 months of stable, sober care"
- "Clean drug tests: December 9, January 31"
- "PLACED.ca + Harper's Place: 21.6MB blueprint"
- "Chose settlement over 103-point rebuttal"
- "Good faith exploited by Applicant"

---

## TONE & DELIVERY TIPS

### Voice
- **Volume**: Loud enough for court reporter
- **Pace**: Slightly slower than conversation (judge is taking notes)
- **Pause**: After key points (let them sink in)
- **Emotion**: Controlled passion (not anger, not begging)

### Body Language
- **Stand straight**: Confidence, not arrogance
- **Eye contact**: With judge (70% of time)
- **Hands**: Use for emphasis (point to exhibits), not fidgeting
- **Movement**: Minimal (stay at podium unless approaching exhibit)

### Persuasion Techniques
- **Rule of Three**: Group facts in threes ("First... Second... Third...")
- **Repetition**: Key phrases ("129 days," "Harper's best interests")
- **Contrast**: Craig vs. Emma (clean tests vs. evasion)
- **Third-Party Validation**: ("Police charged," "Crown charged," "Court ordered")

## ANTICIPATED JUDGE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: "What if the Applicant has changed since December 2024?"**

> "Your Honour, the June 18 email was sent in June 2025—six months after December 9. The 129-day denial lasted through October 2025. The October 6 order violation occurred in October 2025. Her mother's 'Take ME to court' text was October 22, 2025. These aren't ancient history. These are ongoing patterns. If the Applicant has changed, the evidence doesn't show it."

---

**Q: "Should Harper have no contact with her mother?"**

> "No, Your Honour. Harper should have contact with her mother—but it must be supervised. The Applicant's violence, substance use, and contempt of court make unsupervised access unsafe. Supervised access protects Harper while giving the Applicant an opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation. If the Applicant completes recovery, maintains sobriety, and complies with court orders for six to twelve months, access can be re-evaluated."

---

**Q: "Can you and the Applicant co-parent with shared decision-making?"**

> "Your Honour, I tried. In January 2025, I mediated with Kerrie Garland. I reached a settlement. I chose not to file devastating evidence. The Applicant rewarded that good faith with 129 days of contempt. Section 17(h)—willingness to facilitate—requires both parents to support the child's relationship with the other. The Applicant's June 18 email and 129-day denial prove she is fundamentally incapable of that. Shared decision-making requires trust. The Applicant has destroyed that."

---

**Q: "What about the institutional allegations (Jane Ryan, Henderson, Gallant)?"**

> "Your Honour, I'm not asking you to rule on Deputy Chief Henderson's conduct or Jacqueline Gallant's professional ethics. I'm asking you to recognize that these conflicts—documented in formal complaints—undermine the integrity of this proceeding. Independent Legal Counsel for Harper would ensure she has a neutral voice. External investigations would address the systemic issues. But even without those, the evidence before you—June 18 email, 1.4-gigabyte video, 129-day denial—is sufficient to find in Harper's best interests."
