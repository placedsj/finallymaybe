---

## GROUNDS FOR THE MOTION

The grounds for this motion are:

### 1. **Willful Disobedience of Court Orders**

1.1 The Applicant willfully disobeyed multiple court orders granting the Respondent parenting time with the child, Harper June Elizabeth Ryan (DOB: November 12, 2024).

1.2 From **June 4, 2025 to October 10, 2025** (129 consecutive days), the Applicant denied the Respondent all court-ordered Sunday parenting time (8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, 8 hours per Sunday).

1.3 The Applicant denied parenting time on **18 consecutive Sundays**, totaling **144 hours** of willfully denied court-ordered access.

1.4 The Respondent attempted to exercise his court-ordered parenting time every Sunday, as evidenced by:
   - Text message logs sent to the Applicant confirming pickup times
   - Call logs showing unanswered calls at scheduled exchange times
   - Photo timestamps showing the Respondent's presence at the designated exchange location

### 2. **Written Admission of Intent**

2.1 On **June 18, 2025**, the Applicant sent the Respondent an email stating:

> *"You will not see Harper until we see a judge in October."*

**[Exhibit A-8]**

2.2 This email constitutes a **written admission** that the Applicant:
   - Knew of the court-ordered parenting time
   - Intended to violate the court order
   - Would continue to violate the order until October 2025 (approximately 4 months later)

2.3 The Applicant's subsequent actions (denying access for 129 consecutive days) prove she carried out this stated intention.

### 3. **Violation of Further Interim Order**

3.1 On **October 6, 2025**, this Honourable Court issued a Further Interim Order reaffirming the Respondent's Sunday parenting time and explicitly naming **Jane Ryan** (the Applicant's mother) as the exchange facilitator.

3.2 Despite this specific court order, the Applicant continued to deny access for **four additional days** (October 7-10, 2025).

3.3 On **October 13, 2025** (seven days after being named as facilitator), Jane Ryan blocked the Respondent on Facebook, severing communication.

3.4 On **October 22, 2025**, Jane Ryan sent the Respondent a text message stating:

> *"Take ME to court yourself."*

**[Exhibit A-9]**

3.5 This text message constitutes a written admission of Jane Ryan's willful obstruction and contempt of the October 6, 2025 order.

### 4. **Absence of Lawful Excuse**

4.1 The Applicant had **no lawful excuse** for denying the Respondent's court-ordered parenting time.

4.2 The court orders were clear, specific, and enforceable.

4.3 The Applicant was personally served with all relevant court orders and had full knowledge of their terms.

4.4 The Applicant's June 18, 2025 email demonstrates she understood the court orders and chose to disobey them.

### 5. **Prejudice to the Respondent and Harm to the Child**

5.1 The Applicant's contempt caused **measurable harm** to:
   - **The Respondent**: 129 days without his daughter during her first year of life; 144 hours of lost bonding time; emotional distress.
   - **Harper**: Attachment disruption during critical developmental period (ages 6-10 months); denied relationship with father for 42% of her first year; missed developmental milestones (crawling, first foods, language development).

5.2 The denial occurred during Harper's **most critical attachment period**, causing long-term developmental and emotional harm.

### 6. **Pattern of Escalating Defiance**

6.1 The Applicant's contempt demonstrates a **pattern of escalating defiance** of judicial authority:
   - Violated January 14, 2025 order (18 Sundays)
   - Violated March 22, 2025 order (18 Sundays)
   - Violated October 6, 2025 order (4 additional days)

6.2 Each subsequent court order was met with continued disobedience, proving the Applicant views court orders as suggestions rather than binding legal obligations.
