# WITNESS PREPARATION GUIDE
**FDSJ-739-2024 | Testimony Strategy for Craig Schulz**

## Purpose

This guide prepares you (Craig Schulz) for testimony in the custody hearing. It covers direct examination (your lawyer questioning you), cross-examination (Emma's lawyer questioning you), and how to handle difficult questions.

---

## General Testimony Rules

### The Golden Rules

1. **TELL THE TRUTH** - Always. If you get caught in a lie, your entire case collapses.
2. **LISTEN TO THE FULL QUESTION** - Wait for the complete question before answering.
3. **PAUSE BEFORE ANSWERING** - Take 2-3 seconds to think. This gives your lawyer time to object if needed.
4. **ANSWER ONLY WHAT'S ASKED** - Don't volunteer extra information.
5. **"I DON'T KNOW" IS OKAY** - If you don't know, say so. Don't guess.
6. **STAY CALM** - Emotion undermines credibility. Use facts, not feelings.

### Physical Presentation

- **Dress**: Business professional (suit if possible; clean, pressed clothing minimum)
- **Posture**: Sit upright; face the judge when answering
- **Eye Contact**: Look at the judge (not the lawyer asking questions)
- **Voice**: Speak clearly and loudly enough for court reporter
- **Hands**: Keep them visible; don't fidget or cross arms (looks defensive)

## Direct Examination (Your Story)

### Opening Questions (Background)

**Expected Questions**:
- "Please state your full name and date of birth."
- "What is your relationship to Harper June Elizabeth Ryan?"
- "When was Harper born?"
- "Were you present at Harper's birth?"

**How to Answer**:
- State facts clearly: "Craig Alexander Paul Schulz, born [DATE]"
- "I am Harper's biological father."
- "November 12, 2024."
- "Yes, I was in the delivery room."

### The December 9, 2024 Incident

**Expected Questions**:
1. "Can you describe what happened on the morning of December 9, 2024?"
2. "Was Harper present during this incident?"
3. "What did you do to protect Harper?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - The Incident**:
> "On December 9, 2024, I woke up around 6-7 AM. The apartment smelled strongly of methamphetamine. Emma was agitated and appeared intoxicated. I picked up Harper to comfort her. Emma became violent and struck me with a shower curtain rod and a shampoo bottle while I was holding Harper. She was screaming, 'Where's my drugs?!' I recorded the incident on my phone because I was afraid for Harper's safety. After the assault, I called the police and removed Harper from the environment."

**Q2 - Harper's Presence**:
> "Yes. I was holding Harper in my arms when Emma attacked me. Harper was one month old at the time."

**Q3 - Protective Action**:
> "I called 911. When the police arrived, they interviewed both of us and charged Emma with assault. I then took Harper to my family's home to ensure she was safe. I discovered Harper had a severe diaper rash, which I documented with photos. I immediately cooperated with Child Protective Services and submitted to a drug test that same day, which came back clean."

**Key Points to Emphasize**:
- ✅ You were holding Harper (child present during violence)
- ✅ You called police (used legal system, not self-help)
- ✅ You cooperated with CPS (immediate drug test, clean result)
- ✅ Harper had diaper rash (evidence of neglect before removal)

---

### The 129-Day Denial (June 4 - October 10, 2025)

**Expected Questions**:
1. "What happened starting in June 2025 regarding your parenting time?"
2. "How many times did you attempt to exercise your court-ordered Sunday parenting time?"
3. "Did Emma provide any reason for denying access?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - The Denial**:
> "Starting on June 4, 2025, Emma began denying me all court-ordered Sunday parenting time. The Interim Order from March 22, 2025 gave me Sundays from 8 AM to 4 PM. For 129 consecutive days—18 Sundays in a row—I was denied any contact with Harper. This lasted until October 10, 2025."

**Q2 - Your Attempts**:
> "I attempted every single Sunday. I would text Emma the day before confirming the pickup time and location. I would arrive at 8 AM as ordered. I would call and text when she didn't answer the door. I documented every attempt with text messages, call logs, and photo timestamps. All 18 Sundays, I was denied access."

**Q3 - Emma's Reason**:
> "On June 18, 2025, Emma sent me an email that said, 'You won't see Harper until we see a judge in October.' [Refer to Exhibit A-8]. That was her only explanation. She willfully violated the court order for four months because she decided the court order didn't apply to her."

**Key Points to Emphasize**:
- ✅ 129 consecutive days = 42% of Harper's first year
- ✅ You attempted EVERY Sunday (show persistence, good faith)
- ✅ June 18 email is written admission of contempt
- ✅ You used legal process (filed motions), not self-help

---

### Your Sobriety & Recovery

**Expected Questions**:
1. "Have you ever struggled with substance use?"
2. "What have you done to address this?"
3. "Have you submitted to drug testing?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - Honesty About Past**:
> "Yes, I have struggled with substance use in the past. I have been honest about this from the beginning. However, I have been sober since [DATE - check your Celebrate Recovery records]. Harper's safety has been my priority."

**Q2 - Recovery Efforts**:
> "I enrolled in Celebrate Recovery, a faith-based recovery program, and I attend regularly. I also sought psychiatric evaluation to address any underlying mental health concerns. I submitted to drug testing both when CPS requested it on December 9, 2024, and again on January 31, 2025. Both tests were negative—completely clean."

**Q3 - Drug Testing**:
> "Yes. On December 9, 2024, the same day as the assault, I submitted to a 12-panel drug test for Child Protective Services. The result was negative. On January 31, 2025, I took another test. Also negative. I have never failed a drug test during this case."

**Key Points to Emphasize**:
- ✅ Honesty (don't deny past; show growth)
- ✅ Proactive recovery (you sought help, not court-ordered)
- ✅ Clean tests (contrast to Emma's "Negative-Dilute")

### PLACED.ca & Harper's Place

**Expected Questions**:
1. "Can you explain what PLACED.ca is?"
2. "Why did you create this?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - What It Is**:
> "PLACED.ca is a comprehensive co-parenting platform I developed to help separated families communicate, coordinate schedules, track expenses, and document their child's development in a transparent, court-admissible way. It's designed to solve the exact problems this case has exposed—communication breakdowns, access denials, and lack of accountability."

**Q2 - Why You Created It**:
> "I created it because I love Harper and I wanted to ensure that even if Emma and I couldn't be together, we could still co-parent effectively. I also created Harper's Place, a personal app for Harper's care, with features like daily care logs, medical tracking, and milestone documentation. Both show my long-term commitment to Harper's stability and well-being. I didn't just want to win a court case. I wanted to build Harper a better future."

**Key Points to Emphasize**:
- ✅ Innovation (you're forward-thinking, not vengeful)
- ✅ Child-centered (built for Harper's benefit)
- ✅ Long-term commitment (21.6MB Blueprint proves planning)

---

### Your January 18, 2025 Decision (The "103-Point Rebuttal")

**Expected Questions**:
1. "In January 2025, you told Kerrie Garland you had a 103-point rebuttal to Emma's affidavit but chose not to file it. Why?"
2. "What did you mean when you said you 'built the case for her'?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - Why You Didn't File**:
> "On January 18, 2025, I had two options. I could file a response that would destroy Emma's credibility—I had 103 contradictions in her affidavit, I had audio from December 9 that contradicted her statements, and I had evidence that could have buried her in court. Or I could try to reach a settlement for Harper's sake. I chose Harper. I told Kerrie Garland, Emma's sister-in-law, that I would 'own it all'—meaning I would take responsibility for things I didn't do—if it meant Emma and I could work together. I didn't want to drag Harper's mother through the mud. I wanted to co-parent."

**Q2 - "Built the Case for Her"**:
> "I meant that I prepared a comprehensive response that proved Emma's affidavit was false, but I didn't file it. I was willing to let Emma save face if it meant we could settle. Unfortunately, Emma took my good faith and weaponized it. She used my restraint to continue denying me access for 129 days. I learned that protecting Emma came at Harper's expense."

**Key Points to Emphasize**:
- ✅ Sacrifice (you chose Harper over revenge)
- ✅ Good faith (you tried settlement despite having evidence)
- ✅ Emma's betrayal (she exploited your restraint)

## Cross-Examination (Emma's Lawyer)

### Anticipated Attacks

Emma's lawyer will try to:
1. Make you look like a liar
2. Make you look violent
3. Make you look like a drug user
4. Make you emotional (so you lose credibility)

**Your Defense**: Stay calm, stick to facts, use your evidence.

---

### Attack #1: "You're Violent Too"

**Expected Questions**:
- "Isn't it true you and Emma had physical altercations?"
- "Didn't you restrain Emma during arguments?"
- "Kerrie Garland said you 'look just as bad in the videos.' What does that mean?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - Physical Altercations**:
> "No. Emma assaulted me on multiple occasions. On November 19, 2024, she gave me a black eye [Photo A-75]. On November 30, 2024, she assaulted me with a glass mirror; her brother Matt witnessed it [Video evidence]. And on December 9, 2024, she attacked me with a shower curtain rod while I was holding Harper. I never struck Emma. I defended myself and protected Harper."

**Q2 - Restraint**:
> "If I physically restrained Emma, it was to prevent her from hurting me or Harper. In the videos, you may see me holding her arms to stop her from striking me. That is defensive action, not mutual combat. The police investigated and charged Emma with assault, not me. The Crown Attorney charged Emma on September 21, 2025, not me. Third parties validated that I was the victim."

**Q3 - Kerrie's Statement**:
> "Kerrie said I 'looked bad' because in the videos, I'm defending myself. I'm holding Emma's arms, I'm trying to de-escalate, I'm protecting Harper. That might look like conflict, but it's not aggression—it's survival. If Kerrie thought I was the aggressor, why did the police charge Emma? Why did Emma get criminally charged nine months later?"

**Key Strategy**:
- ✅ Redirect to third-party validation (police, Crown, criminal charge)
- ✅ Distinguish defensive action from aggression
- ✅ Use evidence (photos, videos, charges) to prove your account

---

### Attack #2: "You Use Drugs Too"

**Expected Questions**:
- "You admitted to Kerrie Garland that you struggled with substance use, correct?"
- "Isn't it true you were using drugs at the same time as Emma?"
- "How can you say Emma is unfit when you have the same issues?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - Past Substance Use**:
> "Yes, I have struggled with substance use in the past, and I have been honest about it. But I have been sober since [DATE]. I enrolled in Celebrate Recovery. I submitted to drug testing on December 9, 2024—clean. January 31, 2025—clean. I have never failed a drug test during this case."

**Q2 - Same Time as Emma**:
> "No. When Emma was using methamphetamine during pregnancy, I was not. When she was putting meth in Harper's breastmilk in November 2024, I was not using. On December 9, when she was screaming 'Where's my drugs?!', I was calling the police to protect Harper. My drug test that day was clean. Emma's test on January 6, 2025 was 'Negative-Dilute'—meaning she tried to cheat it. The difference is I got sober for Harper. Emma tried to evade accountability."

**Q3 - Same Issues**:
> "We don't have the same issues. I submitted to testing and got clean. She evaded testing. I sought recovery. She facilitated drug purchases through her mother. I protected Harper. She endangered Harper by using while breastfeeding. The evidence speaks for itself."

**Key Strategy**:
- ✅ Admit past, emphasize present sobriety
- ✅ Contrast your actions (recovery, testing) with Emma's (evasion, endangerment)
- ✅ Use "Negative-Dilute" test as proof of Emma's ongoing issues

---

### Attack #3: "You Took Harper to Hurt Emma"

**Expected Questions**:
- "You took Harper on December 9 to punish Emma, didn't you?"
- "You wanted to hurt Emma by separating her from her daughter."
- "If you really cared about Harper, why didn't you try to reconcile with Emma?"

**How to Answer**:

**Q1 - Punishment**:
> "Absolutely not. I removed Harper from a meth-filled apartment where her mother had just violently assaulted me while I held her. Harper had a severe diaper rash from neglect. The environment was unsafe. I called the police—not because I wanted to hurt Emma, but because Harper's safety came first. The police agreed and charged Emma with assault."

**Q2 - Separating Mother-Daughter**:
> "I didn't separate them. Emma's violence and drug use separated them. If Emma had been sober, if she hadn't assaulted me, if she had provided a safe environment, Harper would have stayed with her. But I had a one-month-old baby in my arms being attacked by her intoxicated mother. What would any parent do?"

**Q3 - Reconciliation**:
> "I tried. From January 12-18, 2025, I mediated with Kerrie Garland. On January 18, Emma and I reached a settlement. I told Kerrie I would 'own it all'—meaning I would take responsibility for things I didn't do—if it meant we could co-parent peacefully. I chose not to file my 103-point rebuttal because I wanted to protect Emma and work together. Then, on June 18, 2025, Emma sent an email saying I wouldn't see Harper until October. She took my good faith and betrayed it."

**Key Strategy**:
- ✅ Emphasize safety (not revenge)
- ✅ Use January 18 settlement as proof of good faith
- ✅ Show Emma's betrayal (June 18 email)

---

### Attack #4: "You're Just Trying to Control Emma"

**Expected Question**:
- "This is really about controlling Emma, isn't it? You can't accept that the relationship is over."

**How to Answer**:

> "No. I accepted the relationship was over in December 2024. What I can't accept is Harper being used as a weapon. If this were about control, I wouldn't have built PLACED.ca—a platform designed to help separated parents co-parent without conflict. I wouldn't have reached a settlement in January 2025. I wouldn't have spent 129 days showing up every Sunday, getting denied, and still coming back the next week. This is about Harper's safety and her right to have both parents in her life. Emma's 129-day denial, her June 18 email, her violation of the October 6 order—that's not co-parenting. That's weaponization."

**Key Strategy**:
- ✅ Redirect to Harper (not Emma)
- ✅ Use PLACED.ca as proof of co-parenting intent
- ✅ Use Emma's contempt as proof she's the one refusing to cooperate

## Difficult Questions & How to Handle Them

### "I Don't Remember"

**If you genuinely don't remember**:
> "I don't recall the specific details of that conversation/date/event."

**Never say**: "I don't know" if you should know (makes you look unprepared)

---

### "Yes or No" Trap Questions

**Example**: "Isn't it true you and Emma fought frequently? Yes or no."

**How to Respond**:
> "I need to clarify. We had disagreements, but Emma was physically violent on multiple occasions—November 19, November 30, and December 9, 2024. I never struck her."

**Strategy**: If a "yes" or "no" answer would be misleading, insist on clarifying.

---

### Emotional Triggers

**If Emma's lawyer brings up painful topics** (e.g., "You've lost 129 days with Harper. That must make you angry."):

**How to Respond**:
> "I'm not here because I'm angry. I'm here because Harper deserves better. She deserves a father who shows up, even when he's denied access 18 times in a row. She deserves a parent who is sober, stable, and safe. That's why I'm here."

**Strategy**: Redirect emotion to Harper's needs (not your feelings)

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T SAY:
- "Emma is a terrible mother" → Focus on facts (drug use, violence), not labels
- "I hate Emma" → Emotion undermines you
- "Emma should lose Harper forever" → Courts want co-parenting, not scorched earth
- "I'm perfect" → Admit past mistakes; show growth

### ✅ DO SAY:
- "Emma's substance use and violence create an unsafe environment for Harper."
- "I want what's best for Harper, even if that includes Emma once she gets help."
- "I'm not perfect, but I've been sober for [X] months and I've submitted to testing."
- "I've made mistakes, but I've taken responsibility and sought help."

---

## Practice Questions (Rehearse These)

1. "Why should the Court award you sole decision-making?"
2. "What would you say to someone who argues Emma has changed since December 2024?"
3. "If the Court orders shared decision-making, how will you work with Emma?"
4. "What's your plan for Harper if you get primary residence?"
5. "Do you believe Emma should have any access to Harper?"

**Rehearse with a friend or lawyer. Record yourself. Watch for fidgeting, emotion, or rambling.**
