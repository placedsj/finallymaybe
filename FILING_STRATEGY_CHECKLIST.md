### Key Legal Arguments (Section References)

#### Argument 1: Emma is Unfit Due to Contempt (Family Services Act s. 17(h))

**Claim**: Emma's 129-day denial demonstrates fundamental inability to facilitate relationship with other parent.

**Evidence**:
- June 18 email (Exhibit A-8): Written admission
- 18 denied Sundays (Calendar A-8; Exhibits A-66 through A-75)
- Oct 6 order violation (4-day continued denial)
- Jane Ryan obstruction (Exhibit A-9: "Take ME to court")

**Document Reference**: [130-Day Gap Timeline](./130_DAY_GAP_TIMELINE.md), Part VII (Legal Implications)

**Requested Relief**: Sole decision-making to Respondent; supervised access for Applicant

---

#### Argument 2: Emma is Unfit Due to Violence (Family Services Act s. 17(k))

**Claim**: Emma has engaged in pattern of escalating family violence, creating risk to Harper.

**Evidence**:
- 1.4GB Dec 9 video (EX-V- 12 09 2024.MOV)
- Criminal charge (Sept 21, 2025 - SJPF File #25-2390069)
- Pattern: Black eye (Nov 19) → Mirror (Nov 30) → Knife → Dec 9
- Harper present during Dec 9 assault (child endangerment)

**Document Reference**: [Hard Evidence Compilation](./ASSAULT_ENDANGERMENT_EVIDENCE.md), Part I-II

**Requested Relief**: Supervised access only for Applicant

---

#### Argument 3: Emma is Unfit Due to Substance Use (Family Services Act s. 17(a), (b))

**Claim**: Emma used methamphetamine during pregnancy and breastfeeding, poisoning Harper and creating unsafe environment.

**Evidence**:
- Nov 8 text: Drug use admission (4 days before birth)
- Nov 30 text (A-11): "Meth in breastmilk" admission
- Dec 8 text (C-3): Jane Ryan facilitates meth purchase
- Jan 6 test (A-5): "Negative-Dilute" (evasion)
- May 22 photo (A-6): Meth pipe in residence
- Dec 9 video: "Where's my drugs?!" (Screenshot A-87)
- Harper's low birth weight + NICU (potential prenatal exposure)

**Document Reference**: [Hard Evidence Compilation](./ASSAULT_ENDANGERMENT_EVIDENCE.md), Part III

**Requested Relief**: Drug testing (hair follicle, 90-day window); supervised access pending rehabilitation

---

#### Argument 4: Craig is Superior Parent (Family Services Act s. 17 — All Factors)

**Claim**: Craig has demonstrated superior fitness in every s. 17 factor.

**Evidence**:
- Sobriety: Clean drug tests (Dec 9, Jan 31); Celebrate Recovery participation
- Employment: Atlantic Vet invoice ($531.28); stable income
- Innovation: PLACED.ca + Harper's Place (21.6MB Blueprint)
- 13 months of care: Dec 9, 2024 - present; Harper thriving
- Character: Tom Daly affidavit; criminal acquittal (Sept 29)

**Document Reference**: [Respondent Fitness Package](./RESPONDENT_FITNESS_PACKAGE.md), Part VII (Comparative Fitness)

**Requested Relief**: Sole decision-making; primary residence

---

#### Argument 5: Institutional Conflicts Require Independent Oversight

**Claim**: Systemic conflicts of interest (Jane Ryan ↔ Henderson; Jacqueline Gallant ↔ Emma's brother; Kerrie Garland ↔ Emma) undermine integrity of proceedings.

**Evidence**:
- Formal complaints against Jane Ryan (Ranks #1-2)
- NBASW complaint against Jacqueline Gallant (Rank #3; 105 points)
- Jane Ryan's drug facilitation + Oct 22 text (obstruction)
- Jacqueline Gallant's acceptance of "Negative-Dilute" without follow-up
- Kerrie Garland's mediation → affidavit commissioning (conflict)
- NBASW refusal to investigate Gallant

**Document Reference**: [System Loop Exposure](./SYSTEM_LOOP_ARCHITECTURAL_FRAUD.md), Part IV-VI

**Requested Relief**: Appoint Independent Legal Counsel for Harper; external investigations (RCMP, Provincial Ombudsman)

---

## Oral Argument Strategy

### Opening Statement (5 Minutes)

**Hook (30 seconds)**:
> "Your Honour, Harper June Elizabeth Ryan has lost 42% of her first year with her father — not because of illness, not because of distance, but because her mother wrote in an email: *'You won't see Harper until we see a judge in October.'* That email is Exhibit A-8. That's not co-parenting. That's contempt."

**Roadmap (1 minute)**:
> "The evidence before you proves three things: (1) Emma Ryan is fundamentally unfit due to contempt, violence, and substance use; (2) Craig Schulz has provided 13 months of stable, sober care; and (3) institutional conflicts require independent oversight. I'll walk through each."

**The 130-Day Gap (1.5 minutes)**:
> "From June 4 to October 10, 2025 — 129 consecutive days — Emma denied every court-ordered Sunday. Not once. Not twice. Eighteen Sundays. We have text logs [hold up Exhibits A-66 through A-75], call logs, photo timestamps of Craig showing up at 8 AM. And on June 18, Emma sent this email [hold up Exhibit A-8]: *'You won't see Harper until we see a judge in October.'* That's a written confession of contempt."

**The December 9 Assault (1.5 minutes)**:
> "On December 9, 2024, Emma assaulted Craig while he held one-month-old Harper. We have a 1.4 gigabyte video. [Hold up USB] You will see Emma strike Craig with a shower curtain rod. You will hear her scream, *'Where's my drugs?!'* [Hold up Screenshot A-87]. On September 21, 2025, the Crown formally charged Emma with assault. [Hold up charge docs]. This isn't 'he said, she said.' This is irrefutable."

**Close (30 seconds)**:
> "Harper deserves a sober, stable parent. That's Craig. Emma needs supervised access pending rehabilitation. I respectfully request sole decision-making and primary residence for the Respondent. Thank you."

---

- Q: "The result was 'Negative-Dilute,' correct?" [Show Exhibit A-5]

- Q: "It means the sample was excessively watered down, correct?"

- Q: "Did CPS require you to retest with a hair follicle test?"
- Q: "Why not?"

**Topic 4: December 9 Assault**

## Contingency Planning

### If Emma Files Rebuttal

**Anticipated Claims**:
1. "Craig was violent too" → Rebuttal: No evidence; Craig was victim (black eye, mirror, charged Emma)
2. "Craig uses drugs too" → Rebuttal: Clean drug tests; Emma "Negative-Dilute"
3. "Craig took Harper to hurt me" → Rebuttal: Protective action (Dec 9); 13 months of care proves commitment

**Strategy**: Use [Master Executive Summary](./MASTER_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md), Part VII (Comparison to Applicant's Narrative) for pre-prepared rebuttals.

---

### If Court Questions Evidence Volume

**Response**:
> "Your Honour, I understand the volume is significant. That's why I've prepared a two-page Smoking Gun Quick Reference [hold up] with the top five exhibits that, on their own, prove the case. If the Court has only 15 minutes, start there. Everything else is supporting documentation that cross-references back to those five exhibits."

**Hand to Judge**: [Smoking Gun Quick Reference](./SMOKING_GUN_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

---

### If Court Questions Institutional Allegations

**Response**:
> "Your Honour, I understand these are serious allegations. That's precisely why I'm requesting the Court appoint Independent Legal Counsel for Harper and refer these matters for external investigation. I'm not asking the Court to rule on Deputy Chief Henderson's conduct or Jacqueline Gallant's NBASW violation. I'm asking the Court to ensure Harper has neutral representation given the documented conflicts. The formal complaints speak for themselves [hold up Ranks #1-3 documents]."
