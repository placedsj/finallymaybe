## ⚖️ Legal Arguments Summary

### What We're Asking the Court

**Primary Relief**:
1. ✅ **Sole Decision-Making Authority** → Craig Schulz
2. ✅ **Primary Residence** → Craig Schulz
3. 🔴 **Supervised Access Only** → Emma Ryan (pending rehabilitation)
4. 🚫 **Exclude Jane Ryan** → From supervision/facilitation
5. ⚖️ **Finding of Contempt** → 129-day denial; award costs + compensatory parenting time
6. 👶 **Appoint Independent Legal Counsel** → Harper's neutral voice

**Secondary Relief**:
7. 🔍 **Order Drug Testing** → Hair follicle (90-day window) for Emma
8. 📋 **Refer for Investigation** → RCMP (Henderson ↔ Jane Ryan), NBASW (Jacqueline Gallant), Provincial Ombudsman

### Why We'll Win

**Family Services Act s. 17 - Best Interests Analysis**:

| Factor | Craig Schulz ✅ | Emma Ryan 🚩 |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **(a) Safety & Security** | Removed Harper from unsafe environment (Dec 9) | Assault, meth, child endangerment |
| **(b) Physical/Emotional Needs** | 13 months stable care; Harper thriving | Attachment disruption via 129-day denial |
| **(g) Permanence & Stability** | Sober 13+ months; employed; stable housing | Substance use, violence, relies on Jane Ryan |
| **(h) Facilitate Relationship** | ✅ 100% compliance; 18 pickup attempts | 🚩 **DISPOSITIVE FAILURE**: 129-day denial + June 18 admission |
| **(k) Family Violence** | Victim (documented: black eye, mirror, knife, Dec 9) | Perpetrator (charged Sept 21, 2025) |

**Conclusion**: Factor **(h) - Willingness to facilitate relationship** is **DISPOSITIVE**. Emma's 129-day denial + June 18 written admission + Jane Ryan's obstruction prove **fundamental incapability** to co-parent.
