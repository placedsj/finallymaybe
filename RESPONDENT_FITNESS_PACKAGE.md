**Context**: Kerrie Garland (Emma's sister-in-law) acted as mediator post-December 9 incident.

   - Kerrie witnessed Craig's genuine concern for Emma's welfare
   - Kerrie saw Craig's willingness to "own it all" to protect Emma
   - Kerrie confirmed Craig had devastating evidence but chose not to file it

2. **Respondent's Restraint**:
   - Craig: *"Can't hurt the woman I love defending myself"*
   - Kerrie's response: *"I really hope that it works out for you guys"*

3. **Emma's Sobriety (Kerrie's Assessment)**:
   - Kerrie: *"I was with her over those days and didn't think she was high. Just my opinion."*
   - **Note**: This was January 2025; "negative-dilute" test was January 6, 2025

2. **Primary Residence**
3. **Applicant's Access Restricted to Supervised Only** (pending rehabilitation)

Harper deserves the stability, innovation, and love that the Respondent has consistently provided. The Court must act to protect her from further weaponization and institutional bias.
