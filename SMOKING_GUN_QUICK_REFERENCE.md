## Why This Matters

**Harper has already lost:**
- 🗓️ **129 days** with her father (June-Oct 2025)
- 🎄 **Father's Day 2025** (June 15 - denied)
- 🎂 **First Birthday** (Nov 12, 2025 - obstructed)
- 🎅 **Christmas 2025** (Dec 25 - denied)
- 🧠 **Critical attachment period** (ages 6-10 months)

**Harper deserves:**
- 👨‍👧 A sober, stable, safe primary parent (Craig)
- 🛡️ Protection from violence and drugs (supervised access for Emma)
- 💻 A future planned with love and innovation (PLACED.ca, Harper's Place)

**The evidence is irrefutable. The law is clear. Harper's best interests demand change.**
